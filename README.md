# Data-Structures-2.0
---------------------

# Binary Search Tree
 - This is a data structure composed of Nodes.
 - Included methods are:
    1. insert
    2. contains
    3. size
    4. depth
    5. balance

### Traversal Methods
    - Various methods for traversing the graphs
    1. in_order(self):  will return the values in the tree using in-order traversal, one at a time.
    2. pre_order(self):  will return the values in the tree using pre-order traversal, one at a time.
    3.post_order(self):  will return the values in the tree using post_order traversal, one at a time.
    4. breadth_first(self): will return the values in the tree using breadth-first traversal, one at a time.

### Delete Method
    - Remove value from the tree if present, if not present this method is a no-op. Return None in all cases

### Balance Method
    -  Balance the tree upon the insertion or the deletion of a node. This allows for the Binary Search Tree to be as optimal as possible. 


# Hash Table
- This structure hashes keys and stores the value.   Essentialy we created what Python's dictionary  does.  It lets the user set the number of buckets to store words and then hashes the keys and stores them at the correct index of the list of lists.

### Methods available:
- get - returns the value of a given key
- set - sets a key value pair
