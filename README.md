# Data-Structures-2.0
---------------------

# Binary Search Tree
 - This is a data structure composed of Nodes.
 - Included methods are:
    1. insert
    2. contains
    3. size
    4. depth
    5. balance

A feature of our binary tree is to find a value is an O(1).

# Traversal Methods
    - Various methods for traversing the graphs
    1. in_order(self):  will return the values in the tree using in-order traversal, one at a time.
    2. pre_order(self):  will return the values in the tree using pre-order traversal, one at a time.
    3.post_order(self):  will return the values in the tree using post_order traversal, one at a time.
    4. breadth_first(self): will return the values in the tree using breadth-first traversal, one at a time.
